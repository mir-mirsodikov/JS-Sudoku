# JavaScript Sudoku

A JavaScript Sodoku game.
JS Sudoku [library](https://github.com/robatron/sudoku.js/) from @robatron <br />
I tried to create my own puzzle generator but kept running into problems with backtracking so I used an already existing library.
Using the library I created an interface for it. The 'game.js' file is the main file that is doing all the outputting and formatting.
