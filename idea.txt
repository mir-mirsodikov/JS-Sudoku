---Sudoku---

* Create a simple Sudoku puzzle
    - Put it an array in JS
    - Display it in HTML
    - Make it look pretty with CSS
* Let the user be able to select any square on the board
    - When selected the square should be highlighted
    - Highlight the row and the column as well
* The selected square should be a textbox that allows input from the user
* A button to check progress
    - Have a seperate array with the solution and compare the two
    - If there is an error in the game, highlight the box red with an error
